# EUCAIM_Fedbiomed_demo
Fed-BioMed demonstrator for the EUCAIM project M9 milestone

## Deployment instructions

You may find deployment instructions for Fed-BioMed at the following [link](https://fedbiomed.org/latest/user-guide/deployment/deployment-vpn/#deploy-on-the-node-side). 
Specifically, you should only follow the instructions under the heading "Deploy on the node side". 
Basically, they amount to 
1. building one (or two if you also want the gui) docker image
2. copying a vpn configuration file to a predefined path/name in the docker container
3. generating a public vpn key

To obtain the vpn configuration file, please contact [francesco.cremonesi@inria.fr](mailto:francesco.cremonesi@inria.fr).
When the public key has been generated, please send it to [francesco.cremonesi@inria.fr](mailto:francesco.cremonesi@inria.fr), so it can be registered on the vpn server. 

Some additional information:

- the documentation says to checkout the master branch of fedbiomed. You may alternatively checkout the v4.4.4 tag (or any higher available tag if we push more in the meantime). In any case, the master branch is fine since it is up to date with the latest hotfixes required for correctly building the docker images
- using the GUI is fully optional. In case you donâ€™t want to do it, then obviously there is no need to build the corresponding image
